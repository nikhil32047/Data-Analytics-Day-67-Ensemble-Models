Ensemble Learning & Real-World ML Optimization

ðŸ”¹ Lesson 1: Ensemble Methods Overview
=======================================
Summary:
Ensemble learning combines multiple models to improve accuracy.
Bagging â†’ Reduces variance (e.g., Random Forest)
Boosting â†’ Reduces bias (e.g., XGBoost, AdaBoost)
Stacking â†’ Combines modelsâ€™ predictions for better performance

Example:
A Random Forest outperforms a single Decision Tree on customer churn prediction.


ðŸ”¹ Lesson 2: Random Forests Explained
======================================
Summary:
Builds many decision trees using random samples and averages their results.
Handles missing values well
Prevents overfitting
Great for both classification & regression

Example:
Predicting housing prices with multiple features like area, location, and number of rooms.


ðŸ”¹ Lesson 3: Gradient Boosting & XGBoost
===========================================
Summary:
Boosting = sequential model building, where each new model corrects previous errors.
XGBoost = faster, regularized version of Gradient Boosting
Ideal for structured/tabular data

Example:
Credit risk prediction with XGBoost often beats logistic regression.


ðŸ”¹ Lesson 4: Model Stacking (Meta-Learning)
=============================================
Summary:
Stacking combines predictions from multiple models using a meta-model.
Level 1: Base models (e.g., SVM, Random Forest, XGBoost)
Level 2: Meta-model (e.g., Logistic Regression)
Results in strong generalization

Example:
Stacking models increased F1-score by 6% on a fraud detection dataset.


ðŸ”¹ Lesson 5: Case Study â€“ Insurance Claim Prediction
===================================================
Summary:
----------
Data preprocessing + feature selection
Compare Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost
Stack top 2 models using Logistic Regression
Achieved 94% accuracy on claim prediction
